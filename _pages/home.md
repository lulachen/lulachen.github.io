I am a Research Scientist (previously Postdoctoral Associate) at [MIT](https://web.mit.edu) in [MIT GOV/LAB](https://mitgovlab.org) and the [Department of Political Science](https://polisci.mit.edu). 

At MIT GOV/LAB, I work on projects that study on trust, bureaucracy, and technology in government in the Global South.  I am also interested in foreign policy decision-making and in my dissertation project, I study how individual biases can affect group decision-making in foreign policy.  I use quantitative methods in my research and specialize in policy evaluation using randomized controlled trials and causal inference.  I served as a Methods Specialist with the [Office of Evaluation Sciences](https://oes.gsa.gov) at the U.S. General Services Administration and conducted research on taxation and public service delivery in Malawi as a part of the [EGAP Metaketa Initiative](https://egap.org/our-work-0/the-metaketa-initiative/).  Prior to my doctoral studies, I was a program manager at Sister Cities International for U.S.-Chinese-African trilateral municipal cooperation projects.    

I hold a BSFS in Comparative Studies and an MA in Security Studies from [Georgetown University](https://sfs.georgetown.edu).  I received my PhD in Political Science from the [University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign](https://pol.illinois.edu) in 2021.
