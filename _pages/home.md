I am a Postdoctoral Associate at [MIT](https://web.mit.edu) in [MIT GOV/LAB](https://mitgovlab.org) and the [Department of Political Science](https://polisci.mit.edu). 

My research focuses on the causes and consequences of government policies, particularly in relation to groups and public goods.  In my dissertation project, I study how individual biases affect group decision-making in foreign policy.  I also specialize in policy evaluation using randomized controlled trials, causal inference, and quantitative methods.  I served as a Methods Specialist with the [Office of Evaluation Sciences](https://oes.gsa.gov) at the U.S. General Services Administration and conducted research on taxation and public service delivery in Malawi as a part of the [EGAP Metaketa Initiative](https://egap.org/our-work-0/the-metaketa-initiative/).  Prior to my doctoral studies, I was a program manager at Sister Cities International for U.S.-Chinese-African trilateral municipal cooperation projects.    

I hold a BSFS in Comparative Studies and an MA in Security Studies from [Georgetown University](https://sfs.georgetown.edu).  I received my PhD in Political Science from the [University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign](https://pol.illinois.edu) in 2021.
